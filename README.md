# Turtle Graphics

Imagine a turtle walking around on an infinitely large plane. The 
turtle has two possible options:
1. Move forward a certain distance.
2. Rotate a certain angle.

Now imagine the turtle is holding a pen, such that we can follow its
tracks. If we fix a certain set of rules for the turtle to move, then 
it draws out some interesting patterns!

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Matt Henderson, which showed this principle
in a [video](https://youtu.be/tkC1HHuuk7c?si=Vq04vwa7FscY7ZMp) on Numberphile.

## Installation
